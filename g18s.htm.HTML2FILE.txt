***** Foreword by the HTML-Writer *****
This HTML-file is a light version of the book
     Ashby, Wendy/ Clark, Ronald:
     18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa,
     The Interlanguage for Europe and the World,
     3rd edition Â© 1992 by Glosa Education Organizaton,
     Richmond, UK; ISBN 0Â 946540Â 15Â 2.
You can buy the book from Wendy Ashby (c/o Glosa Education 35 Wingfield Road;
Kingston Upon Thames; Surrey KT2 5LR; ENGLAND). By purchasing this Â£8.95 book,
you will be helping Glosa to grow.
USA-citizens can buy a paper copy of this HTML-document from Gary Miller ([[E-
mail address of
  Gary as PNG-image]]) for 5Â USD plus shipping.
This file does not contain the whole book, and does not aim to. Though all the
sample sentences and rules have been included, only Steps 1-3, 5, 9, 13 and 16-
18 are really complete. The GlosaÂ 1000 vocabulary list is missing, please refer
to the Glosa_Internet_Dictionary. This version is meant only as a supplement to
Glosa's presentation on the Internet. There is also a German and an unfinished
Russian version available.
From the book itself, and from a letter from Wendy Ashby, I draw the
conclusion, that this book is intended to be THE_official description of Glosa.
Thanks to Wendy Ashby for the permission to put this on the net and to Nick
Hempshall for his comments. Please report errors to [[E-mail address as PNG-

***** The Global Language for the Global Village *****
A truly International Auxiliary Language must be easy to learn for motivated
people everywhere. It must not become a merely holiday language for comfortable
westerners.
It must be easy for the Third World Villager as well as for western scientist
and poet. Just such a language is Glosa, which simplifies, improves and
economizes international communication.
Glosa is the ideal oral complement to the electronic Information Technology
Revolution.
All the old languages face the student with lists of frightfully strange-
looking words, which have to be thoroughly memorized plus a complex Grammar.
In contrast all Glosa words are already internationally familiar and in lively
daily use not only in Europe but everywhere modern Medicine and Science
penetrate.
The late Prof. Lancelot Hogben pointed out that "The world-wide vocabulary of
Science is the nearest thing to the lexicon of a truly Global Language that
Mankind has yet achieved. It derives its words from two dead languages - Latin
and now, almost exclusively Greek."
Although Glosa has a very large Mega Vocabulary, its heart, its centre consists
of only 1000 words which can easily cope with any kind of intelligent
conversation accurately and euphoniously.
The Mechanics of Glosa neatly summarized on one page shows how 20 little words
of the 1000 deal easily with Tense, Comparison, Number etc.
There are 18 lessons, each one with exercises for translation from English into
Glosa, and vice versa [In this file, the exercises and translations have been
brought together as parallel columns.]. Each lesson contains parallel English
and Glosa sentences. Simple informal letters are provided in alternate lessons,
and useful phrases.
Many informative illustrations [A lot of them not in this file].
The vocabularies at the back list Glosa 1000 into English and a 2000 word
English vocabulary into Glosa 1000 [Not in this file.].
Each Glosa word stands for a Concept, rather like the head word in Roget's
Thesaurus.
Each Glosa word can act as any part of speech, as do Chinese and, increasingly,
English. The Glosa student will quickly discover that there is much color and
poetry in the Greek and Latin roots of Sci-tek Terminology, and they will soon
acquire a network of colorful associations. Each Glosa word is a little sun,
from which radiate a host of derivatives in all the Euro-languages, including
German and Russian.

***** Preliminary Notes *****
**** Pronunciation ****
Every letter must be pronounced including the final vowel.
5 vowels as in Spanish, and as pronounced in English: fAther, cafE, machIne,
mOre, lUnar.
Try to pronounce O like English AW.
Diphthongs. Pronounce vowels separately.
Consonants as in English with following exceptions:
Â Â C always pronounced like CH in English CHurCH.
Â Â J as Y in Yes.
Â Â R must always be pronounced, preferably trilled.
Â Â G must always be hard as in Get.
Â Â H should always be pronounced as in English Help.
Â Â Q pronounced as English QU or KW.
Â Â SC always pronounced like English SH (- but is very rare. A regular
pronounciation like S-CH should be possible, too).
(Addition, see the book "Glosa 6000", p. 17:) One or two Greek words start off
with awkward-looking pairs of consonants as in psychology. It is prefereable to
pronounce the P, but not essential, and can be left to individual discretion.
Analogously, X in the beginning of a word could be pronounced like S, but
pronouncing it KS would be better.
Accent gently on vowel before last consonant.

            Glosa     pronounciation

instead     vice      veechay
meat        karni     kahrrnee
blue        ciano     cheeahnaw

question    qestio    kwaysteeaw (error in original: "questio")
swing       osci      awshee
white       leuko     layookaw
**** Spelling ****
Spelling is phonetic. Greek PH replaced by F, CH by K, Y by I, TH by T.

**** Alphabet ****
The letters are named as follows (Spelling shows English pronunciation):
AH, BAY, CHAY, DAY, AY, FAY, GAY, HAY, EE, YAY, KAY, LAY, MAY, NAY, AW, PAY,
KOOAY, RAY, SAY, TAY, OO, VAY, DEEPLAW VAY (error in original: "DUPLO VAY")
EKS, EE GREK, ZETAH.

**** Punctuation ****
Colon precedes items of a catalogue. Fe stude: biologi, kemi.
Comma separates items from each other.
Semi-colon separates clauses, principal and subordinate.
A clause is a group of words containing a finite verb.
There are plenty of examples in the book.

**** -co ****
This is the Glosa form of the Italian word ciÃ², which means this, that. In
Glosa it means "what I've just said".
It helps to make the very useful Logical Connectors listed below. Glosa is a
semantically based language, so that when a group of words shares a common
element of meaning this is indicated in the form of each word.
In the old languages like English and French this common element finds no
expression.
If you study the following list you will quickly see the usefulness of the
device, and will find it easy to make up many others. [Note: In the original
book all except ex-co are without hyphens. -co never stands alone, but always
in combinations of this kind.]
po-coÂ     after that
plus-coÂ   moreover
homo-coÂ   similarly
para-coÂ   by the way
suma-coÂ   summing up
fini-coÂ   finally
seqe-coÂ   consequently
kontra-coÂ conversely
ko-coÂ     also
klu-coÂ    even so
akorda-coÂ accordingly
hetero-coÂ otherwise
per-coÂ    in this way
tem-coÂ    meanwhile
anti-coÂ   however
metri-coÂ  to that extent
no-klu-coÂ apart from that

English_original: Â Â  It cast a gloom over the boat, there being no mustard. We
ate our beef in silence. Existence seemed hollow and uninteresting. We thought
of the happy days of childhood, and sighed. We brightened up a bit, however,
over the apple tart, and when George drew out a tin of pineapple from the
bottom of the hamper, and rolled it into the middle of the boat, we felt that
life was worth living after all.
We are very fond of pineapple, all three of us. We looked at the picture on the
tin; we thought of the juice. We smiled at one-another, and Harris got a spoon
ready.
Then we looked for the knife to open the tin with. We turned out everything in
the hamper. We turned out the bags. We pulled up the boards at the bottom of
the boat. We took everything out onto the river bank and shook it. There was no
tin-opener to be found.
Then Harris tried to open the tin with a pocket-knife, and broke the knife and
cut himself badly; and George tried a pair of scissors, and the scissors flew
up, and nearly put his eye out.
While they were dressing their wounds, I tried to make a hole in the thing with
a spiky end of the hitcher, and the hitcher slipped and jerked me out between
the boat and the river bank into two feet of muddy water, and the tin rolled
over, uninjured, and broke a teacup.
Then we all got mad. We took that tin out on the bank, and Harris went up into
a field and got a big sharp stone, and I went into the boat and brought out the
mast, and George held the tin and Harris held the sharp end of his stone
against the top of it, and I took the mast and poised it high up in the air,
and gathered all my strength and brought it down.
It was George's straw hat that saved his life that day. [...] Harris got off
with merely a flesh wound.
After that I took the tin off myself, and hammered at it with the mast till I
was worn out and sick at heart, whereupon Harris took it in hand.
We beat it out flat; we beat it back square; we battered it into every form
known to geometry - but we could not make a hole in it. Then George went at it,
and knocked it into shape, so strange, so weird, so unearthly in its wild
hideousness, that he got frightened and threw away the mast. Then we all sat
round it on the grass and looked at it.
There was one great dent across the top that had the appearance of a mocking
grin, and it drove us furious, so that Harris rushed at the thing, and caught
it up, and flung it far into the middle of the river, and as it sank we hurled
our curses at it, and we got into the boat and rowed away from the spot, and
never paused until we reached Maidenhead.

Shakespeare
Trying to translate Shakespeare into Glosa, and preserving sense and rythm as
much as possible is a very good exercise. Try to keep to Glosa 1000 as much as
possible.
Shakespeare: Richard II. Act 3, Scene 2 (After Glosa text some notes and
English original):
Glosa:
... de konfort, ze-pe dic:
Las na dic de tumb, de verm, e epitaf;
Fac pulve na papir; ko pluvi ok
Graf tristi epi facia de u ge.
Elekt plu lega-pe; dic testament:
Sed, ne so, - na pote dona qo?
Except na pove soma ad u ter?
Na land, na vit, pan es de Bolingbroke;
E nuli-ra es de na excepti mort
E u mikro model de u sika ter;
Qi es u tegu pasta de na os.
Pro Teo, las na sed ad epi ter;
Dic de tristi morta de plu reg
Kom plu pa lose tron; plu ge-cid in guer,
plu ge-seqe ex plu-la mu pa cid,
Plu ge-toxi per mu gin; plu, somni, ge-cid.
Pan ge-cid: - ka in koelo koron;
Qi rond u morta kefa de u reg;
Morta tena kort; e la u bufon sed;
ridi anti an; joko de an pomp;
Permito an respir u mikro sken,
Te monarki; sti fob, e cid per skop;
Infusi an ko vani vanita
Kom si u sark, qi cirku mur na vit
Es fo-resista ma; e ridi so,
Veni a fin, e per u mikro spin
For dia an kastel mur, ... e vale, reg!
Tegu tu kef; ne ridi anti mi
Ko solem revere; bali respekt,
Traditi, form, e ceremoni deb;
Ka tu mis-logi mi a-nu;
Mi vora pan kom tu,
Ski trist, vol ami; ge-limita so,
Qo-ka tu dic a mi, mi es u reg?
Some_eti-notes; literal translation of some L & G roots:
line 2 EPI-TAPH G. on-tomb
10 G. steiro, barren better? but sika, dry is in Glosa 1000
17 G. koelo, hollow. The G. is cog with the E.
24 G. sarko, flesh. sarcastic, flesh-tearing. Sarcophagus flesh eating.
L is carni- as in carni-vorous.
26 L. spina, thorn, pin.
English_original:
... of comfort, no man speak.
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.
Let's choose executors, and talk of wills;
And yet not so - for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives, and all, are Bolingbroke's.
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
How some have been deposed, some slain in war;
Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,
Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,
All murder'd - for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp;
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life
Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,
Comes at the last, and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!
Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence; throw away respect,
Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty;
For you have but mistook me all this while.
I live with bread like you, feel want, taste grief,
Need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?

Mega-Glosa
Many people might not like being restricted to only 1000Â words. Partly because
they have long been used to the large vocabularies of the west. Such people at
first may prefer to use the larger MEGA-Glosa.
However, as Glosa aims to be a truly International Auxiliary Language it must
be kept simple so as to appeal to the motivated worker of the Developing World.
GlosaÂ 1000 must remain as the centre, the Heart of the language.
It must be emphasized again that GLOSAÂ 1000 can easily cope with any kind of
theme, including perhaps even highly specialized subjects with perhaps an
occasional dip into Mega-Glosa.
It is to be hoped however that while enjoying the freedom and variety of Mega-
Glosa the user will however learn how to exploit GlosaÂ 1000.
The large Euro-vocabularies contribute to much misunderstanding, not only
between nations and classes, but even between individuals of the same class. By
forcing oneself to make full use of GlosaÂ 1000 one has to keep thinking in the
beginning about meanings.

preferable.

"The world-wide vocabulary of Science is the nearest thing to the lexicon of a
truly global Language that mankind has yet achieved. It derives its words from
